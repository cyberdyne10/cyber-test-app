1,What is "need-to-know" principle?,Users should access only data required for their tasks,Users should access all data,Users should access no data,Users choose access,1
1,Why are audit logs important for data security?,Track who accessed or changed data,Improve graphics,Change colors,Increase marketing,1
1,What is "data at rest"?,Data stored on disks, tapes, or other media,Data traveling on network,Data in RAM only,Data on screen only,1
1,What is "data in use"?,Data actively processed in memory,Data in backups,Data in archives,Data on paper,1
1,Why should sensitive data not be stored in plain text?,Can be easily read if exposed,Improves performance,Changes fonts,Reduces color,1
1,What is a data retention policy?,Defines how long to retain different types of data,Defines password length,Defines themes,Defines storage brand,1
1,Why should old backups be disposed of according to policy?,To reduce risk and storage use,To increase risk,To reduce uptime,To change vendors,1
1,What is "least privilege" for data access?,Grant minimum data access needed for role,Grant access to all data,Grant no access ever,Grant random access,1
1,Why is database activity monitoring useful?,Detect suspicious queries and access patterns,Improve latency,Change schemas,Reduce memory,1
