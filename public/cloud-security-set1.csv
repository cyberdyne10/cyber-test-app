1,Why is region selection important for cloud security and compliance?,Data residency and legal requirements vary by region,It changes CPU speed,It controls VLAN IDs,It sets Wi‑Fi channels,1
1,What is the purpose of tagging cloud resources?,Organization, cost tracking, and sometimes policy control,Increasing bandwidth,Encrypting data,Creating VLANs,1
1,What should you do before exposing a cloud VM directly to the internet?,Harden it and restrict ports with a firewall,Enable all ports,Disable logging,Use default credentials,1
1,Which tool can help detect public exposure of cloud storage buckets?,Cloud security posture management (CSPM),Word processor,Spreadsheet,Antivirus only,1
1,What is a common risk of using public AMIs or images from unknown publishers?,Embedded malware or backdoors,Better performance,More storage,Improved encryption,1
1,Why is auto-scaling relevant to security?,It can absorb traffic during attacks but must be controlled to avoid abuse,It replaces firewalls,It encrypts all traffic,It patches systems automatically,1
1,What is "least privilege" in the context of IAM roles?,Grant only necessary permissions for a task,Grant all permissions for convenience,Grant no permissions ever,Grant permissions randomly,1
1,What should you regularly review for cloud IAM users and roles?,Access keys and assigned policies,Screen resolution,Printer names,Cable colors,1
1,Why is it dangerous to use long-lived access keys in cloud environments?,They can be stolen and used for a long time,They reduce CPU usage,They speed up routing,They are required by compliance,1
1,What is the best way to allow developers to access production logs securely?,Through role-based access and audit logging,Give everyone SSH root access,Email log files,Disable logs,1
1,What does "infrastructure as code" (IaC) help with from a security perspective?,Consistent, reviewable, version-controlled configurations,Random manual changes,Unlogged changes,Fewer backups,1
1,Why should security groups be reviewed regularly?,To remove overly permissive rules like 0.0.0.0/0,To increase IP address usage,To reduce encryption,To disable backups,1
1,What does "0.0.0.0/0" mean in a cloud security group?,Open to the entire internet,Open to local subnet only,Open to one host only,Blocked to all,1

1,Why is monitoring billing in cloud important for security?,Unusual cost spikes may indicate abuse or compromise,It speeds up servers,It replaces firewalls,It increases bandwidth,1
1,What should you do when an API key is suspected to be compromised?,Revoke/rotate it immediately and investigate,Ignore it,Share it,Post it online,1
1,What is a common way to restrict management access to cloud consoles?,Use MFA, IP restrictions, and role-based access,Allow anonymous logins,Disable passwords,Use guest accounts,1
